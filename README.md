# AI NPC: Artificial Intelligence applied to a Non-Playable Character
## Description
This project aims to integrate artificial intelligence into an NPC (Non-Playable Character) within a game environment. The project used Unreal Engine 5.4.4 as the development environment and made use of plugins such as ConvAI and MetaHumans. More details are in [AI_NPC](https://github.com/NichAttGH/AI_NPC/blob/main/AI_NPC.pdf)

## Main activities
- Creation of an NPC capable of interacting with users via verbal communication.
- Implementation of different communication modes, including Push-to-Talk, Flip-Flop and voice activation.
- Enabling actions such as following the user, moving to an object and back, and interaction with objects in the environment.

## Tools used
- Unreal Engine 5.4.4
- ConvAI Plugin.
- QuixelBridge Plugin.
- MetaHuman Avatars

## Conclusions
The project demonstrated the feasibility of implementing AI in NPCs to create more immersive and interactive game experiences. Flip-Flop communication has proven to be the most accurate, while buttonless communication, although with some issues, is the most suitable for the project goal. Future prospects include solving the problems of buttonless communication, implementing custom actions, and more interaction with the environment.
